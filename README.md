This is the first lab for CSE 5543: Geometric Modeling in Spring 2018. 

My implementation uses Processing, a small package that allows for quick creation of graphical user interfaces (GUIs), which allows me to easily create buttons, input fields, and display the curves.

Using algorithms learned in class, one can 

1) Create, delete, and edit points in the drawing area
2) Choose the type of curve they'd like
3) Adjust parameters for the given curve

These curves form the building blocks for meshes in the modeling industry, and the curves themselves are used by animators.
